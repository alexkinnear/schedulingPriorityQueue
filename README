The 3 priorities that I imnplimneted are start time, deadline, and duration.
The first one prioritizes the deadline so that the task with the nearest deadline
is done first.

Time: 1 Task 1
Time: 2 Task 1
Time: 3 Task 1 **
Time: 4 Task 3 **
Time: 5 Task 6 **
Time: 6 Task 4
Time: 7 Task 4 **
Time: 8 Task 2
Time: 9 Task 2
Time: 10 Task 2
Time: 11 Task 2 ** Late 1
Time: 12 Task 5
Time: 13 Task 5
Time: 14 Task 5
Time: 15 Task 5
Time: 16 Task 5 ** Late 5
Tasks Late: 2 Total Late: 6

The second one simply does the tasks in the order that they become available.
If multiple tasks become available at the same time, the priority task is the
one with the nearest deadline.

Time: 13 Task 5
Time: 14 Task 5
Time: 15 Task 5
Time: 16 Task 5 ** Late 5
Tasks Late: 3 Total Late: 11

The third one prioritizes the shortest duration of the tasks. This one can be
inefficient at times because some of the shorter tasks may become available
later in the day, but will still be given priority and may leave the start of
the day unproductive.
